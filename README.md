All the functions can be found in the `Bot` class in the [pytgbot/bot.py](https://github.com/luckydonald/pytgbot/blob/master/pytgbot/bot.py) file.
They are pythonic in small letters with underscores instead of camel case, for example [getUpdates](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getupdates) is `bot.get_updates`

## Examples ##
Have a look into the [examples](https://github.com/luckydonald/pytgbot/tree/master/examples) folder.

## In case of errors ##
First you should set logging to level `DEBUG` to see what's going on.
```python
# add this to the first lines in your file
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
If you are about to open a new issue, search the existing ones (open and closed) first.
Sometimes they are already reported or even solved.
